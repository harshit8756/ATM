## Prerequisites

Before you proceed, ensure that you have the following installed on your system:

1. Java Development Kit (JDK) - Make sure you have Java installed. You can check by running the following command in your terminal/command prompt:

   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

## Cloning of the project

Make  a clone of the repository

   git clone https://github.com/harshit8756/ATM.git
```

## Compiling the Java Project

To compile the Java project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root directory of your project (the one containing the `ATM` folder and this `README.md` file).

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ATM
   ```

3. Compile the Java source files. If you are using an IDE, you might not need to run this step as the IDE typically handles compilation for you.
